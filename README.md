# Advanced Computer Architecture Coursework

This repository will contain all resources to do with my Advanced Computer
Architecture coursework.

In this coursework I will build an instruction set architecture as well as a 
super-scalar processor simulator for it. I will be coding this in `rust`, which
is a new language for me so excuse any novice tendancies!
